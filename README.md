# poker-bot

This was a tentative to implement a bot that used some "hand-built" OCR to detect the current state of a poker game.
The bot would take screenshots periodically and analyse the hand, re-creating a model of the game, so that an artificial intelligence could be plugged into this model to automatically decide the best outcome for each hand.

It focused on the Poker Stars client exclusively, which has dramatically changed since then (2012) that I'm pretty sure this doesn't work anymore :)

It was very naive approach, which is probably why I never finished the project, but I got some pretty good results at the time, at least in reading the table model.
